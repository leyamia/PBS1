# PBS1
A C++ project that implements extended functionality for Vector3D and Matrix3x3 classes, including vector/matrix equivalence, string formatting, multiplication, and transpose operations.

It focuses on extending existing C++ implementations of mathematical classes `Vector3D` and `Matrix3x3` with new functionality such as:
- Floating-point comparison using epsilon
- String representation using `std::stringstream`
- Matrix equivalence by row comparison
- Matrix multiplication
- Matrix transpose


⚙️ Compilation
Make sure your compiler supports C++20.
